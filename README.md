# Aissms--Codebreakers

This project aims to build a bridge between donors and NGOs, fostering stronger connections and increasing charitable giving.  The core idea is to provide donors with greater control and transparency over their contributions.  Instead of simply donating to a general NGO fund, donors can choose specific projects or initiatives they wish to support.  The platform then tracks these designated donations, providing updates and reports on how the funds are being utilized and the impact they're making.  To further encourage giving, the platform incorporates a reward system, where donors earn points or other incentives for their contributions, which can be redeemed for various perks.  This combination of transparency, direct impact, and rewards aims to create a more engaging and fulfilling donation experience, ultimately benefiting both donors and the NGOs they support.
